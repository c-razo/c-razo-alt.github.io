## SSL/TLS Configuration Project

**Description**: This project was initiated after a Nessus scan identified an SSL certificate trust issue on a local Apache server. The scan result prompted a hands-on project to set up HTTPS using a self-signed SSL certificate on Apache.

**Steps Taken**:
- Used OpenSSL to generate a self-signed certificate and configure Apache for HTTPS.
- Updated Apache settings to listen on port 443 and configured SSL.
- Tested the setup by accessing `https://localhost` and documented the browser’s security warning.

**Tools Used**: Nessus, OpenSSL, Apache

**Outcome**: Successfully configured Apache to use HTTPS, demonstrating basic SSL/TLS setup and encryption, despite the self-signed certificate warning.
